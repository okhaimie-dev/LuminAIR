LuminAIR is being developed in carefully planned phases to address the challenges of proving 
large-scale machine learning models while enabling practical use cases early on. 

Below is the roadmap outlining our phased approach to building and expanding LuminAIR.

# 🏗️ Phase 1: Supporting Primitive Operators

<Accordion title="Support All Primitive Operators">

In this foundational phase, LuminAIR focuses on supporting a minimal set of **11 primitive operators**, 
which are sufficient to implement a wide range of machine learning models, such as linear regression, convolutional networks, and transformers.

| Operator     | Status |
| ------------ | ------ |
| `Log2`       | ⏳     |
| `Exp2`       | ⏳     |
| `Sin`        | ⏳     |
| `Sqrt`       | ⏳     |
| `Recip`      | ✅     |
| `Add`        | ✅     |
| `Mul`        | ✅     |
| `Mod`        | ⏳     |
| `LessThan`   | ⏳     |
| `SumReduce`  | ✅     |
| `MaxReduce`  | ⏳     |
| `Contiguous` | ✅     |

- These operators are implemented via the `PrimitiveCompiler`, a subset of the `StwoCompiler`.
- Each operator requires a corresponding specialized component in the AIR (Algebraic Intermediate Representation).

# 🔒 Phase 2: Optimizations and Accessibility

This phase focuses on improving performance and developer experience by introducing fused compilers, specialized operators, and easier integration tools.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Implement Fused and Specialized Compilers">

    A small primitive operator set can lead to computational graphs with hundreds or thousands of operations, making them slow to execute and prove.
   
    To address this, we will:
    - Develop compilers that fuse multiple primitive operations into efficient composite operators.
    - Add support for common ML operators like `MatMul`, `SoftMax`, and `ReLU`.
    - Extend the AIR with specialized components for these new operators.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Improve DX with a Python SDK">
    Currently, LuminAIR is written in Rust, requiring users to interact with it through Rust code.
    A Python SDK will be developed to make LuminAIR more accessible to data scientists and ML practitioners who are more familiar with Python.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="WASM Verifier Support">
     This task will enable proof verification directly in web browsers using WebAssembly (WASM).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# 🔒 Phase 3: Decentralized Verification and GPU Support

This phase aims to bring LuminAIR proofs into decentralized ecosystems and enhance performance through GPU acceleration.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Onchain Proof Verification">
    Deploy the LuminAIR verifier as a smart contract for decentralized proof verification.
    Possible approaches include:
	- Implementing the verifier as a [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/) program verified on Starknet.
	- Leveraging Ethereum’s crypto-economic security via [AVSs](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/avs) networks like [Aligned Layer](https://alignedlayer.com/).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Support for Icicle-Stwo Backend (GPU Acceleration)">
    Integrate support for [Icicle-Stwo](https://github.com/ingonyama-zk/icicle-stwo), which enables GPU acceleration via CUDA backends.
    This will significantly improve the speed of proof generation for large-scale models  
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# 🔒 Phase 4: Future Enhancements
Details for this phase are yet to be finalized but may include:
- Support for ONNX graph.
- Continuation mechanism, allowing the proof to be divided into several parts that can be proved in parallel.
- Expanding compatibility with additional ZK backends.
